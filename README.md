# git

useful commands aliased in your git config so you don't git into trouble :D

##### Divergence 
commits we added and commits remote added

##### Goodness 
summary of diff lines added/removed/total

##### Fancy logging.
h = head
hp = head with patch
r = recent commits, only current branch
ra = recent commits, all reachable refs
l = all commits, only current branch
la = all commits, all reachable refs
